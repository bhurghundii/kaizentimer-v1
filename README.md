## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

pnpm dev
```

## This is a prototype 

I am really shocked at the lack options so I am going to rebuild this again using the Pages Router for Next.JS and approach it with AWS Amplify in mind right from the get go. I'd imagine a lot of the code is transferable so let's see
